⭐ 1. What is Prisma?
Prisma is an ORM → Object-Relational Mapper.

⭐ 3. So what is Prisma actually made of?
Prisma has 3 important parts:

⭐ PART 1 — Prisma Schema
A file called schema.prisma.
You describe your tables (models) here.

⭐ 6. What databases does Prisma support?
Prisma supports many:
✔ SQL Databases
PostgreSQL
MySQL
MariaDB
SQL Server
SQLite
✔ NoSQL
MongoDB (limited features)
So NO, Prisma is NOT only for SQL.
But its main strength is SQL databases (especially PostgreSQL).


⭐ 10. Prisma is not a database, right?
Correct.
Prisma = Tool
PostgreSQL = Database
Node.js = Application
Prisma sits between Node.js and PostgreSQL to make life easier.
