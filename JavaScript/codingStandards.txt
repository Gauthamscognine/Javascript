basically netscape came into picture and made etscape explorer , seeign thisi microsoft made interney explorer , but then it was all static , then net scape made a language called as mocha  thenr enmed to live script and then again renamed to javascript , this was for use for the people , but this javascript could work only on netscape explorer , seeing this mcrosoft , made jscript ysing javascript which would work only on internet explorer.. then internet explorer and jscript hwere free ,but js and netscarpe were pay for use , so due to some losses , net scape was sold to aol and then firefow was built using net scape open source doe and this swas the end of net scape . then in 2008 chrome came with its won engine , every broweser had their own engine  and the v8 came which said u can run and compile and intrepret js in the nrowser itself , then came node js inorder to have an js enovrimne tengine to run js even in backend and local susem .
in middle came ecmascript , long back wehn they were revenge between net scape and micrsofrt , so that time as ie was free , then netscape went to ecamscript and said consider my js as a standard languas , and ecame script which is not clled es gives new version every year . 
this is the whole history of js .




✅ Complete, Sorted, and Polished History of JavaScript
1. The Early Web (Pre-1995)

In the early 1990s, web pages were static—only HTML and images.

Netscape Navigator became the dominant browser.

Netscape wanted to make websites interactive.

2. Birth of JavaScript (1995)
Netscape creates a new language

Netscape hired Brendan Eich to create a scripting language for the browser.

He developed the first version in 10 days.

Initial naming journey

Mocha → first internal name

LiveScript → early public name

JavaScript → final marketing name

The name “JavaScript” was chosen because Java was incredibly popular at the time.
(Despite the name, JavaScript is not related to Java.)

3. The Browser Wars Begin (1995–2000)
Netscape vs Microsoft

Seeing JavaScript’s success, Microsoft reverse-engineered it and created:

JScript → Microsoft’s own implementation

JScript only worked in Internet Explorer, while JavaScript worked in Netscape Navigator.

Compatibility chaos

Every browser implemented JavaScript differently.

Websites broke on different browsers.

This became known as the First Browser War.

4. ECMA Standardization (1996–1999)

To stop fragmentation:

Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International.

The standardized version was named:

ECMAScript (ES)

ES1 (1997) → first edition

ES2 (1998)

ES3 (1999) → major features still in use today

ECMAScript is the standard, JavaScript is the implementation.

5. Netscape Falls (1998–2003)

Netscape struggled because Internet Explorer was free and bundled with Windows.

Netscape was acquired by AOL (1999).

The browser eventually died.

Mozilla & Firefox

Before dying, Netscape open-sourced its code → Mozilla project was born.

Mozilla built Firefox (2002–2004) using Netscape’s open-source code.

Firefox became the spiritual successor of Netscape.

6. Google Chrome & Modern JavaScript Engines (2008)

Every browser had its own JS engine:

Firefox → SpiderMonkey

Safari → JavaScriptCore

IE → Chakra

Then came Google Chrome with:
V8 Engine (2008)

Compiles JavaScript to machine code instead of interpreting it.

Super fast → changed the entire web performance landscape.

Allowed JavaScript to run complex applications inside the browser.

7. Server-Side JavaScript (2009)
Node.js is released (Ryan Dahl)

Built using Chrome’s V8 engine.

Allowed JavaScript to run outside the browser, on servers and local machines.

Enabled:

backend development

command-line tools

desktop apps (Electron)

full-stack JS development

This was a major revolution.

8. ECMAScript Renaissance (2015–present)

After years of slow updates (ES4 failed):

ES6 / ECMAScript 2015

A major update:

let/const

arrow functions

classes

promises

modules

spread/rest operators

This rebooted JavaScript’s evolution.

Yearly releases

ES2016

ES2017

ES2018

…and so on
Each year adds new features.

9. Modern Browser Landscape (2010s–2020s)

Chrome → dominant

Firefox → still active

Safari → strong in Apple ecosystem

Internet Explorer → discontinued (replaced by Edge)

Edge now uses Chromium (and V8)
