//Whenever a prisma command is invoked, the CLI typically reads some information from the schema, e.g.:
//prisma generate: Reads all above mentioned information from the Prisma schema to generate the correct data source client code (e.g. Prisma Client).
//prisma migrate dev: Reads the data sources and data model definition to create a new migration.

//Prisma Schema files are written in Prisma Schema Language (PSL)
